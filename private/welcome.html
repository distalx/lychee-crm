    Hi There ,<br><br>

    I'm John, founder of Lychee POS. I'm happy to have you onboard!<br><br>

    It looks like you have the app right in hand already, but please email me anytime you have an issue, I'm here to help.<br><br>

    PS: if you have a second, I'd love to hear more about what made you sign-up, what are your current situations/needs etc!<br><br>

    thanks,<br>

    -- John
